# 🌀 lostInThree

This project marks my first steps into the world of **Three.js** and **WebGL** — where 3D graphics meet the web.  
It’s mostly an experiment playground where I learn, build, break, and explore what’s possible inside the browser.

> Just me, a cup of coffee, and a lot of triangles. ☕

## 🚀 About

**lostInThree** is a journey through shaders, noise gradients, lighting, and interactive 3D scenes —  
a personal space to experiment and get comfortable with Three.js fundamentals.

Currently working on:

- 🟣 Smooth animated backgrounds
- 🌫️ Noise and gradient shaders
- 🧠 Learning WebGL concepts step by step
- 🧩 Building small visual experiments and effects

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Three.js** — 3D rendering engine for the web
- **Vite** — fast development environment
- **JavaScript / ES Modules**
- **GLSL** — for shader experiments
- **HTML + CSS** — for structure and style

---

## 🧪 Goals

- Understand the basics of rendering, camera, and scene setup
- Play with lights, shadows, and post-processing
- Create animated backgrounds and WebGL-driven effects
- Maybe... end up making something beautiful 🎨

## 🗂️ Project Naming

This is part of my personal learning series: `Feeling-Rusty-A-Bit`, and now — **`Lost-In-Three`**

---

## 💭 Final Note

I don’t know exactly where this will go —  
but I’m sure I’ll get **lost (in a good way)** along the way. 🌌
